# pythonteaching
Contains Python teaching materials.
This git repo does NOT contain any solutions to the questions. It only includes lecture notes and questions, so that it prevents current CS61A students from cheating.

# lec, hw folder
- py file: Students will edit this file to reach the correct solution 
- autograder.pyc / Q{number}.pyc files (Python 3.6.3): Students can check if their solution is correct by running pyc files. 
- wwpd_{name}.pyc files (Python 3.6.3): Students will have to answer 'what would python display (wwpd)' by typing directly into the terminal.
- The homework solution will not be posted to avoid potential academic dishonesty in cs61a.
